### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 14-year old software and app developer based somewhere around the Sierra Nevada. I love writing programs in languages from Python to Flutter. I teach programming and develop curriculums in my spare time. I've been learning how to code since 2017. I write a lot in Python, however I'm also trying to use other languages more. If you'd like to contact me, you can email me at [dirigo112@gmail.com](mailto:dirigo112@gmail.com) or [nielsen.peter.a@icloud.com](mailto:nielsen.peter.a@icloud.com).

Some projects of mine:
- [Python Puzzles](https://github.com/peternielsen112/puzzles): a set of puzzles written in Python to give learners a challenge.
- [Hope For The Galaxy](https://github.com/peternielsen112/hopeforthegalaxy): a Pygame Zero game with starfighters, lasers, and a whole lot of fun!
- [Mathematical Transformations](https://github.com/peternielsen112/mathematical-transformations): a couple of little math scripts for dilations, rotations, etc of triangles.
- [Hope For The Galaxy Classic](https://github.com/peternielsen112/hftgclassic): a less resource-intensive version of Hope For The Galaxy, perfect for a learner's introduction to Pygame Zero.
- [Periodic Table Index](https://github.com/peternielsen112/periodictableindex): an index of the 118 elements of the Periodic Table of Elements. Written in Python.
